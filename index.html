       <p>
          During the times of Covid, I watched loads of movies and the majority of them were Tamil.<br>
          I love the songs and movies of Tamil Nadu...I've been listening to Arabic Kuthu since the last three years and all my friends and family are exasperated with it as I play it endlessly.<br>
          My favorite 
          <ul class="Movie">
            <li>Musician: Aniruddh Ravichander</li>
            <li>Actor: Vijay Sethupathi</li> 
            <li>Director: Lokesh Kanagaraj.</li>

            Watched <span>F.R.I.E.N.D.S</span> 3 times.Next step to showcasing my obsession is by buying a t-shirt I think.<br>
            Only watched one K-drama till now called <span>When the Phone Rings</span> and it was fabulous.<br>
            Like I said before, also love watching Tamil movies.
